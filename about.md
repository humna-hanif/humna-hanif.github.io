# About Me

<p style="color:#0099FF;"> My name is Humna, pronounced like the word "hum" and then just a "nah" (don't know why people mispronounce it when its spelled the exact way it is pronounced). I am 18 years old and from Hamden, Connecticut. I am a freshman in college. I attend Quinnipiac University and major in Software Engineering.

## Why Software Engineering?
<p style="color:#0099FF;"> Growing up I loved technology. Even today, I'm always trying to keep up to date with all of my devices. I've always knew that I would want to have a career somewhere in the technological area. I never took a coding class before college but I was always intrigued and wanted to learn more. The first "coding project" I ever did was the Hello World on some random website online. After just doing that one simple code I fell in love. Programming is something very different. It's like learning a new language that only very few actually understand. Shortly after, I started looking into Computer Science and Software Engineering. I found myself liking coding more and found myself trying to find more information on programming and coding languages. One fact that stood out to me when looking into these two majors was how their is very little female representation. As a woman this disappointed me and now after declaring my major I feel like I'm doing my part. Off topic but I also got a reassurance when I was watching a show called Blacklist. There was this one character who worked for the FBI and was the "tech guy". You would always see him behind the scenes doing his cool, techy stuff like coding or doing things to help cybersecurity and much more. Overall I'm so happy that I chose Software Engineering as my major. Although it can be frustrating and hard I've always loved challenges. With coding there isn't only one approach to something, there are multiple and an individual is given the ability to program something any way they'd like.

## Involvement/Leadership
<p style="color:#0099FF;"> I am very involved and am part of different organizations at Quinnipiac University. I am part of the Alpha Delta Pi(ADPi) sorority and currently hold a position as the Public Relations Assistant. Fun fact I am the only girl in my sorority who is an engineering major! I am also a part of Circle of Sisterhood where we recently raised money for a school build in Malawi, Africa (I'm also in the PR committee). To list a couple more I am a part of The Big Event(PR Committee), QTHON, Girls Who Code, and the Muslim Student Association.

# About Me

<p style="color:#0099FF;">My name is Humna, pronounced like the word "hum" and then just a "nah" (don't know why people mispronounce it when its spelled the exact way it is pronounced). I am 18 years old and from Hamden, Connecticut.</p>

<p style="color:#0099FF;">I am a freshman in college. I attend Quinnipiac University and major in Software Engineering. </p>

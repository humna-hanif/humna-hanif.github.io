# My Projects

## Color Swatches
<p style="color:#0099FF;"> This was one of the first projects I made for my SER-120 Object Oriented Programming course. The language used was Java. For this project I created two instances of a cartoon and incorporated a color swatch. The user is able to change the color of the head and/or body of the cartoon. This is done so by clicking on the color from the swatch and then clicking on the part of the cartoon you wish to change the color of, either the head or body. Another feature includes the user being able to drag the body of the cartoon without having the other parts of the body move with it. If the head is dragged everything, including the body, is moved the same distance (if the body was moved prior to this the body would still be detached, it will just move the same amount).

## Starbucks vs Dunkin
<p style="color:#0099FF;"> This project was one I created for my CSC-109, Git class. The language used was Java. This assignment helped learning about the features of Git and branching/pulling requests. I created a fun, interactive questionnaire. If anyone know me I LOVE coffee. I'm a huge Starbucks fan and so this interactive project asks users if they like Starbucks or Dunkin better. It's very entertaining as the responses are unique(and a little funny &#129315).
